# Dotfiles
The more I tinker around with Unix/bash/Linux, the more unorganized my dotfiles become - so, I decided to finally to do this right. These dotfiles are currently only working on OSX, but I'm working on adding support for Arch Linux and other distros soon.

### Installation
Thanks to [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), installing my dotfiles is relitively easy.

Just clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/jakedex/dotfiles.git`, cd into the dotfiles folder `cd dotfiles`, and run the install script `source install`

### Configuration
The configuration for dotbot is in install.conf.yaml. See [dotbot's documentation](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#configuration) for more details on how to link files/derectories and run shell commands during the configuration process.
